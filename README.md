# language
A logical language designed from the ground up to work with computers and people

The goal of the project is to research and develop a new universal language that can be easily learned because it is based on rationality, logical structure, and considers the blind, hearing impared, dyslexic before it is designed. This means it will also include new characters, grammar etc.

## list of language goals:
* easy to learn
* unambiguious sounding of characters
* sentence structure that works with humans and computers
* characters that are engineered to be read and written quickly
* based on concepts that a language could have not been based on when created over time when needed

## list of research needed
* study other languages, understand sentence structure
* benchmark sentence logic parsing speed with different language structures
* study fonts / characters
* study speech / reading disorders
* obtain list of essential concepts without synonyms
* study and conceptualize all discovered scientific fields to define a basic language structure that is logical and based off structured human observation.
* study fundemental words that can be used to describe everything without the need to create new words
* design computer system with api to manage the entire language (way later)
